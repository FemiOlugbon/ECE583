# ECE583

## This repository contain programs develop for ECE583 Lab Projects for Digital Systems Design
These are lab projects I prepared solution for during my role as a TA for ECE583 for Spring 2022
ModelSim intel FPGA Starter Edition Software was used for the class

### Lab Project 1 => One bit Full Adder
Provided code for the full adder implementation in Verilog
Written the testbench for simulation.
Provided a ModelSim do file to run all the commands. 

### Lab Project 1 => One bit Full Adder
Implemented a four-bit from the one-bit full adder implementation in Verilog
Written the testbench for simulation.
Provided a ModelSim do file to run all the commands.
